		<h1>Rules-Based ETL for Documents</h1>
		<p>Grooper is a software platform that uses artificial intelligence to conquer the most challenging document processing tasks. Organizing, understanding, <strong>Grooping</strong>, and collecting information from documents has never been this easy. Or fast. Or accurate.</p>

			<h5>Achieve results</h5>
			<h2>Focus on your business, not writing code</h2>
			<p>In the realm of document imaging, text classification, workflow, and data collection, there are endless tools out there that claim to be able to help.
				The problem is that these "tools" are no more than a collection of APIs, SDKs, plugins, widgets, algorithms, and frameworks.
				None of these options provide you with a complete solution.
				Instead you write lots of custom code, chain together technologies from different providers, and work through long, costly deployment and testing cycles where you are effectively forever tied to the vendor writing the custom code.
			</p>
			<h3>You need <em>Grooper</em>.</h3>
			<!--But to get meaningful value from them, you still have to build or find a starting platform that is flexible enough to integrate with all of these third-party components, and you have to have a development team proficient in many different disciplines as you work to accommodate these various components.-->
		</section>

		<section class="col-1">
			<h5>You deserve a unified experience</h5>
			<h2>One platform to rule them all</h2>
			<p>Grooper is a unified platform that comes <em>out-of-the-box</em> with all the components you need. When you choose Grooper, your software contract is a single line-item and all the features it has to offer are immediately at your fingertips.
				Grooper converges document imaging, OCR, computer vision, Regular Expression, electronic workflow, and machine learning to enable you to tackle even the toughest ETL projects without writing code.
				Grooper's <em>Design Studio</em> is where you create the design methods used in your ETL specification.  In this specification you create RULES to transform data into intelligence.

					<h3>Invoice Processing</h3>
					<p>GROOPER’S powerful Data Capture and Image Enhancement functionality is used to process millions of invoice pages for automated processing by a major Retail Company.
						Paper Invoices were scanned and enhanced using our revolutionary Image Processing Functionality.
						Electronic invoices are automatically collected using our RULES engine.
						Using GROOPER’S out of the box AI Invoice Model every data element is collected from incredibly complex multi-page invoices documents with 99.9%-character accuracy.
						This includes all payment information (header data) along with every line item contained in complex tables within the invoices across multiple invoice pages.
						GROOPER’S Unstructured Table Extraction capabilities made this possible without creating a single extraction template.
						A single data model is used to process invoices for tens of thousands of different payables vendors without writing a single line of code to perform complex even the most complex accounting calculations.
						<!--Accounting staff has virtually eliminated the mundane and time-consuming process of manual invoice/PO matching.  Data entry has virtually been eliminated.  Invoices move to payment at light speed allowing this company to capitalize on payment discounts that couldn’t be captured without this Robotic automation.-->

					<h3>CRM Contact Collection</h3>
					<p>We challenged our Grooper technical team with a fun project to automate the collection of contacts we received from business cards.
						The challenge was to create an environment that would receive business card images captured from mobile phones and automate the entry of those contacts into our hosted CRM solution.
						One of the design goals was to make it simple.  To do this without creating a custom image capture application that users needed to install on their mobile devices.
						Team GROOPER took the challenge.
						Today business card images are received from mobile devices via a targeted email account.
						Using GROOPER’s Computer Visioning and our Exclusive Image Enhancement Library we extract contact data directly from every business card using our AI to identify the sender as well as all pertinent contact details.  The sender immediately receives an electronic contact record for the business (.vcf).
						While the person who provided their card receives an electronic cardfor the person they gave the card too.
						<!--This resulted in a very effective way to eliminate duplicate contact records within our CRM environment while demonstrating a fun way to share the concept of our framework.-->

			<h5>GDPR, HIPAA, PCI, FERPA, Reg Z... </h5>
			<h2>Mitigage Risk and Ensure Compliance</h2>
			<p>No matter what business you're in, industry and government regulations dictate many of the decisions you make every day, and compliance is not optional.
				Failure to do so can result in fines, public relations battles, class-action lawsuits, and decreased client retention.
				Grooper identifies at-risk documents in <a href="./electronic-documents.html">any document location</a>, be it file shares, content systems, FTP directories, or email servers.
				Where Grooper really stands above other solutions is its ability to take action once these documents are found, giving you the option to redact, delete, or relocate these documents to a more secure location.

					<h3>Legal Discovery</h3>
					<p>Legal discovery projectsUse Grooper’s AI to review large volumes of electronic documents and emails associated with a civil action involving a large Electric Power Company.
						Our native machine learning and NLP isolated sections of each document along with emails that contained language where an intent was stated to mislead, conceal and hide information.
						Our RULES automatically created an entity list which contained the contact information for each participant involved in the communication stream.
						A timeline was automatically created that outlined all correspondence chronologically.
						Data was ranked and classified from each entity and Sentiment Analysis of the text was performed resulting in an organized dataset of key pieces of evidence by entity in chronological order.
						Legal staff was able to quickly find the smoking gun associated the case based on the data provided from opposing council.   </p>

					<h3>PCI Compliance</h3>
					<p>Another Financial Organization built a robotic process to crawl through billions of document pages analyzing each word and data element within electronic reports to isolate datasets that contained sensitive Personally Identifiable Information that was stored in open information systems.
						Information was automatically isolated, moved, redacted or purged while all at risk data was secured according to predefined business rules.
						All of this was accomplished with standard configuration.
						They didn’t write a single line of code.
