					<p>Another Financial Organization built a robotic process to crawl through billions of document pages analyzing each word and data element within electronic reports to isolate datasets that contained sensitive Personally Identifiable Information that was stored in open information systems.   Information was automatically isolated, moved, redacted or purged while all at risk data was secured according to predefined business rules.  All of this was accomplished with standard configuration.  They didnâ€™t write a single line of code.</p>
